"""Which campaigns one multi-campaign builder run covers (readiness plan C2).

With ``DW_API_HZDR_BUILDER__OUTPUT_ROOT`` set, one builder run builds every
campaign that receives events, plus the ``_unassigned`` bucket, instead of the
one configured campaign. This module holds the layout rules that run follows;
``api/scripts/hzdr-hdf5-builder.py --output-root`` does the building.

Layout, all derived from a campaign's ``experiment_id``:

- its spool files: ``<spool_dir>/<campaign>/<filename>`` (``spool.py``);
- its LabFrog export: ``<curated_root>/<campaign>/<campaign>.sqlite``, the
  layout labfrog-sqlite-tools writes; a campaign without one builds from its
  events alone (trigger-only shots, plan W6.1);
- its output: ``<output_root>/<campaign>/<campaign>.nxs``, and the bucket's
  ``<output_root>/_unassigned/unassigned.nxs``;
- one shared catalog, ``<output_root>/hzdr_sources.json`` by default, where
  each build replaces only its own entry (source key = ``experiment_id``), so
  the API serves them all and its rulings sidecar is the one every build reads.

The campaigns a run builds are the configured ``campaigns`` (those taking
shots now), every campaign with a spool folder, and every campaign the
resolution chain routes an ``unassigned`` event to. The LabFrog step of that
chain reads the exports of the first two groups only, the same records in
every build of the run: LabFrog numbers repeat from campaign to campaign (an
old export holds shots 1..N too), so reading every export under the curated
root would make each authoritative number ambiguous.
