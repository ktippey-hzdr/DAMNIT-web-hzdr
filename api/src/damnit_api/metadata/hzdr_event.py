"""Canonical ``hzdr-event-v1`` envelope contract.

The authoritative copy of this file lives in DAMNIT-web-hzdr at
``api/src/damnit_api/metadata/hzdr_event.py`` (the shared event model is
described in that repo's ``docs/architecture.md``). There is no shared
Python package between the repos today, so the file is vendored
byte-identically into:

    planet-watchdog/watchdog_core/hzdr_event.py

by ``DAMNIT-web-hzdr/hzdr/scripts/sync-hzdr-event.ps1`` — edit only the
DAMNIT copy, then re-run the sync with ``-Apply``. The shotcounter producer
(``hzdrTangoDSShotcounter``) builds a plain-dict event of the same shape and
vendors only the JSON fixtures.

Every transport event (LaserData/ASAPO, DAQ File Watchdog/Kafka,
DRACO-Trigger/Kafka, ...) must validate against ``HZDREventV1``. In DAMNIT,
``hzdr_sources.py`` and ``hzdr_nexus.py`` derive their event-shaped logic
from this model instead of maintaining independent field lists.
