"""Frames numbered by set and ordinal, or a recording's frames, and their comment.

A port of shot-aligner's ``diagnostics/sequence_frames.py`` ``write`` to h5py,
with the same output, and the one part of it this rewrite exists for: **a
recording streams**. shot-aligner fills a pre-shaped stack but keeps the first
frame for its display copy; here each frame is read, appended to a chunked
gzip-4 dataset (one frame per chunk, unlimited first axis) and released before
the next is read, so a 200-frame pco.edge recording costs one frame of memory.
There is no display copy (decision 6).

The recorder comment (``<frame>.tif.rec``, UTF-16, written by pco.camware once
per recording) is parsed into typed settings and kept verbatim, as shot-aligner
does; its parser is part of this pack there, so it is ported here.
