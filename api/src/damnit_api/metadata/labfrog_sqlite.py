"""Read-only reader for curated LabFrog campaign SQLite snapshots.

The sibling ``labfrog-sqlite-tools`` repo exports one SQLite file per campaign to
``curated_files/<Campaign>/<Campaign>.sqlite``.  Each file carries an
``export_metadata`` table (campaign source, ``row_count``, ``exported_at``) and a
``shot_summary`` view of the shot records.  That repo owns the Mongo -> SQLite
extraction; DAMNIT-web only *reads* the produced files, so this module never
opens Mongo and never writes (every connection uses a ``mode=ro`` URI).

This gives DAMNIT-web an authoritative list of unique campaigns plus real
per-shot records, without any database access. The Review matches page uses
the campaign keys as suggestions when a reviewer assigns a shot to a campaign.
