# `NXhzdr_target` Profile — v0.1

Updated: 2026-07-02

The first versioned definition of the HZDR-local `NXhzdr_target` profile: the
semantic map from `metadata.target.*` to the `/entry/sample` NeXus group, and
the compatibility-attribute contract the writer stamps until a real NXDL
ships. This is a profile *document*, not an NXDL — see §6 for what's still
open.

## 1. Purpose and naming rationale

HELPMI (the HZDR-led Helmholtz Laser-Plasma Metadata Initiative) finished on
2026-07-02 without publishing an official `NXtarget` NeXus base class. Rather
than wait indefinitely or squat on the unqualified `NXtarget` name — which
looks official and could collide with a future upstream class — HZDR defines
its own local profile: **`NXhzdr_target`**.

**Compatibility-first strategy:** generated files keep `NX_class="NXsample"`
on `/entry/sample` so any standard NeXus/HELPMI tool can still read them. The
HZDR profile is layered on top as attributes, not as a replacement class:
`damnit_nx_class="NXhzdr_target"` and `damnit_nxdl_version` (this document's
version). Once a real `NXhzdr_target` NXDL is written and bundled with a
validator, HZDR can decide whether profile files should set
`NX_class="NXhzdr_target"` directly (§6).

## 1.1 Literature and standards basis

The profile is intentionally conservative: it uses official NeXus terms where
they exist, marks HZDR-only semantics explicitly, and keeps the generated file
readable by generic NeXus/HDF5 tooling.

| Design decision | Source basis | Consequence for `NXhzdr_target` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Use `NXsample` as the compatibility class | The NeXus `NXsample` base class is the standard place for sample information and already defines `name`, `chemical_formula`, `temperature`, `description`, `type`, `thickness`, `physical_form`, sample environment, and incident beam links ([NeXus `NXsample`](https://manual.nexusformat.org/classes/base_classes/NXsample.html)). | `/entry/sample` keeps `NX_class="NXsample"` and maps the overlapping target fields onto standard `NXsample` datasets first. |
| Keep HZDR-specific fields visibly local | The NXDL manual says NeXus class definitions are the standard glossary; extra items may be inserted, but they are not part of the standard unless defined by an NXDL/application definition ([NeXus NXDL](https://manual.nexusformat.org/nxdl.html)). | HZDR extensions use `damnit_*`, `target_ref`, `gas_species`, and `prop_*` attributes under a named local profile instead of pretending they are upstream NeXus fields. |
| Write a prose profile before claiming a formal class | NXDL files are machine-readable definitions that can be validated against XML Schema and used to validate data files ([NeXus NXDL](https://manual.nexusformat.org/nxdl.html)). | v0.1 is a profile document only. A real `NXhzdr_target` NXDL and validator bundle are required before files can safely set `NX_class="NXhzdr_target"` directly. |
| Avoid the bare name `NXtarget` | Official NeXus class lists define the standard namespace ([base classes](https://manual.nexusformat.org/classes/base_classes/index.html), [application definitions](https://manual.nexusformat.org/classes/applications/index.html)). As of the v2026.01 manual used for this review, `NXsample` exists and no official `NXtarget` base class is documented there. | The local class/profile name is prefixed as `NXhzdr_target` to avoid implying official NIAC status or colliding with a future upstream class. |
| Prefer standard units metadata over unit suffixes in keys | NXDL standardizes common terms including engineering units, and fields carry unit categories such as `NX_LENGTH`, `NX_TEMPERATURE`, and `NX_PRESSURE` ([NeXus NXDL](https://manual.nexusformat.org/nxdl.html), [`NXsample`](https://manual.nexusformat.org/classes/base_classes/NXsample.html)). | Stored metadata keys stay bare (`thickness`, `temperature`, `gas_pressure`); the NeXus writer stamps `@units` at write time. |
| Keep laser and target as adjacent but separate concepts | NeXus already models the radiation source and beam via `NXsource` and `NXbeam`, including laser/source type, frequency, wavelength, pulse energy, beam extent, incident wavelength, and polarization ([`NXsource`](https://manual.nexusformat.org/classes/base_classes/NXsource.html), [`NXbeam`](https://manual.nexusformat.org/classes/base_classes/NXbeam.html)). | `NXhzdr_target` only covers target/sample semantics; laser semantics stay in `/entry/instrument/laser` as `NXsource` + `NXbeam`. |
| Keep bridge collections out of the target profile | `NXcollection` is explicitly unvalidated and intended for arbitrary grouped terms ([`NXcollection`](https://manual.nexusformat.org/classes/base_classes/NXcollection.html)). | The canonical shot/event tables can remain `NXcollection`, but target fields that need durable semantics are promoted into `/entry/sample`. |
| Plan ontology annotation as a later pass | The NeXus Ontology creates machine-readable identifiers for NeXus classes and fields and is designed for annotation/tagging and mappings to other vocabularies ([nexusformat/NeXusOntology](https://github.com/nexusformat/NeXusOntology)). | v0.1 records which fields are standard NeXus fields; URI annotation is deferred until the NXDL/ontology pass. |

Broader RDM alignment supports the same shape. DAPHNE4NFDI emphasizes linked
metadata capture, data catalogues, and reuse workflows for photon/neutron
large-facility data ([DAPHNE4NFDI](https://www.daphne4nfdi.de/)); SciCat positions
itself as a scientific metadata catalogue for findability and sharing
([SciCat](https://www.scicatproject.org/)); and the FAIR principles emphasize
machine-actionable metadata for findability, interoperability, and reuse
([Wilkinson et al. 2016](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618)). The
Plasma-MDS schema is not a laser-plasma target standard, but it supports the same
decomposition into plasma source, medium/target, diagnostics, and resources
([Franke et al. 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-00771-0)).

## 2. Semantic map: `metadata.target.*` → `/entry/sample`

| `metadata.target` key | NeXus path (under `/entry/sample`) | Canonical unit | HELPMI DDC term (§3.4) | Upstream NeXus field? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | `name` (dataset) | — (string) | — | Standard `NXsample.name` |
| `material` | `chemical_formula` (dataset) | — (string) | Material | Standard `NXsample.chemical_formula` |
| `thickness` | `thickness` (dataset), `@units` | nm | Thickness | Standard `NXsample.thickness` |
| `temperature` | `temperature` (dataset), `@units` | °C (`C`) | Sample temperature | Standard `NXsample.temperature` |
| `diameter` | `diameter` (dataset), `@units` | mm | Diameter | **Profile extension** — no standard `NXsample` field |
| `gas_pressure` | `gas_pressure` (dataset), `@units` | bar | Gas pressure (gas jet) | **Profile extension** — no standard `NXsample` field |
| `substrate_material` | `substrate_material` (dataset) | — (string) | Substrate material | **Profile extension** — no standard `NXsample` field |
| `notes` | `description` (dataset) | — (string) | — | Standard `NXsample.description` |
| `provenance` | `@damnit_provenance` (group attr) | — (string enum: `wiki`/`manual`) | — | **Profile extension** (HZDR attr, not NeXus-standard) |
| `wiki_ref` | `@target_ref` (group attr) | — (string, URL/id) | — | **Profile extension** (HZDR attr) |
| `gas_species` | `@gas_species` (group attr) | — (string) | Gas species (gas jet) | **Profile extension** (HZDR attr) |
| `properties.*` | `@prop_<key>` (group attr, one per key) | as given (open bag, no registry unit) | — | **Profile extension** (HZDR attr) |

`name`, `material`, `thickness`, `temperature` are **standard NXsample**
fields — a plain NeXus reader gets useful data with no knowledge of this
profile. `diameter`, `gas_pressure`, `substrate_material` are **profile
extensions**: still written as plain datasets (so generic NeXus tooling can
still read the value), but there is no upstream `NXsample` field they map to
— they only have meaning under the `NXhzdr_target` semantic layer. `type` is
recorded in `metadata.target.type` (§3, target-ontology.md) but is not yet
written into `/entry/sample`; see §6.

Fields absent or `null` in `metadata.target` are skipped entirely — never
written as empty/null datasets or attributes (see `write_nexus_sample()` in
`api/src/damnit_api/metadata/hzdr_nexus.py`).

## 3. Profile attributes spec

Stamped on the `/entry/sample` group by `write_nexus_sample()`:

| Attribute | Value | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `NX_class` | `"NXsample"` | always | Compatibility class; never changes to `NXhzdr_target` until §6 is resolved |
| `damnit_nx_class` | `"NXhzdr_target"` | always | Marks the group as following this profile |
| `damnit_nxdl_version` | `HZDR_TARGET_PROFILE_VERSION` (currently `"0.1"`) | always | Must match this document's version (§4) |
| `damnit_provenance` | `"wiki"` \| `"manual"` | if `provenance` present | Curated vs. hand-entered target |
| `target_ref` | string (URL or stable id) | if `wiki_ref` present | Link back to the MediaWiki target record |
| `gas_species` | string (e.g. `"Ar"`, `"N2"`, `"He"`) | if `gas_species` present | Gas-jet / cluster species |
| `prop_*` | one attr per `properties` key, value as given | if `properties` present | Open extras bag (target-ontology.md §4); not unit-registry-backed |

`HZDR_TARGET_PROFILE_VERSION` is the module-level constant in
`api/src/damnit_api/metadata/hzdr_nexus.py` (next to `write_nexus_sample()`);
its value must always equal this document's version number.

## 4. Versioning rule

Bump `damnit_nxdl_version` / `HZDR_TARGET_PROFILE_VERSION` on **any** change to
the semantic map in §2 or the attribute spec in §3 — a field added/removed/
retyped, a unit changed, or an attribute renamed. The writer constant and this
document's version must always agree; a mismatch means one of them was
updated without the other. Non-semantic edits to this document (wording,
typo fixes) do not require a bump.

Current version: **0.1** (first drafted version, 2026-07-02).

## 5. Known deviations

- **`/entry/instrument/laser/beam` nests `NXbeam` inside `NXsource`.**
  `write_nexus_laser_group()` writes `/entry/instrument/laser` as `NXsource`
  and then a `beam` sub-group as `NXbeam` *underneath* it. Upstream NeXus
  convention more commonly places `NXbeam` as a sibling under `NXinstrument`,
  or attaches it under `NXsample` (the beam incident on the sample). HZDR's
  nesting groups the beam with its originating source instead, which reads
  naturally for a single-laser beamline but is not the most common upstream
  pattern. **Accepted as a deviation for now** — revisit if/when this profile
  is formalized into an NXDL and cross-checked against a validator that
  enforces placement.

No other deviations are tracked in v0.1.

## 6. Future work

- **NXDL formalization.** Write an actual `NXhzdr_target` NXDL file (XML,
  following the standard NeXus definitions schema) encoding §2/§3 as formal
  field/attribute definitions, and bundle it with a validator (`cnxvalidate`/
  `punx` or equivalent) so generated files can be checked against it directly
  instead of only against this prose document.
- **`NX_class="NXhzdr_target"` decision.** Once the NXDL is bundled with
  validation tooling, decide whether HZDR-profile files should set
  `NX_class="NXhzdr_target"` directly on `/entry/sample` (dropping, or
  keeping alongside, the `NX_class="NXsample"` compatibility value). Tracked
  as [alignment-implementation-plan.md Phase 5](plans/alignment-implementation-plan.md#phase-5--hzdr-owned-ontology-annotation--openpmd-interoperability-).
- **`type` field.** `metadata.target.type` (target-ontology.md §3) is not yet
  written into `/entry/sample`; add a mapping (dataset or attribute) in a
  later profile version if downstream consumers need it in the NeXus file
  itself rather than only in the source `metadata` JSON.
- **NeXus Ontology URIs.** Route 4 (standards-alignment.md) calls for
  annotating covered fields with `nexusformat/NeXusOntology` URIs where they
  exist; §2's "Upstream NeXus field?" column is the starting point for that
  pass.
