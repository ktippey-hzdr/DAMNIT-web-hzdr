## Development setup

See the [README](README.md) for how to set up and run the project.
`scripts/setup-dev.sh` installs the dependencies and the git hooks.

## How checks run

The git hooks give you fast feedback locally and run in stages:

- On commit: ruff (backend), eslint and prettier (frontend). These lint
  and auto-format the files you changed.
- On push: type checks (frontend tsc and Python pyright).
- In CI: every check runs again and gates the merge.

CI is the real gate. The local hooks just let you catch issues before you
push.

## Bypassing hooks

The hooks are local convenience, not the gate. For a work-in-progress
commit you can skip them:

    git commit --no-verify

CI still runs every check, so nothing slips through.

## Test Coverage Map

Generated from a real pytest-cov run by
[`scripts/docs/refresh_coverage_map.py`](scripts/docs/refresh_coverage_map.py).
Nothing else writes these numbers, and no figure here is typed by hand. The same
block is transcribed onto this project's page in the `fwkt-webapps`
documentation hub, so a stale map here is a stale map there.

Scope is `damnit_api`. The frontend has its own suite and is not measured here.
This is also not [`hzdr/docs/status/testing.md`](hzdr/docs/status/testing.md),
which carries one row *per constellation repository* — that answers "how well
tested is the constellation", this answers "which parts of this API are tested".

<!-- test-coverage-map-start -->

Use this generated map as a quick sense of which parts of the API are well covered before
changing a reconciler, a router, or the NeXus builder. Percentages come from the latest
pytest-cov JSON run over `damnit_api`; the frontend is not measured here.

Overall `damnit_api` line coverage from that run: **82.00%**.

### Coverage commands

```sh
cd api
uv run --group test pytest -q --cov=damnit_api \
    --cov-report=json:../cover/coverage.json
cd ..
uv run --group test python scripts/docs/refresh_coverage_map.py
```

`cover/` is gitignored; only the rendered block above is committed. Add
`--check-only` to fail when the committed map no longer matches the latest run.

**Adding a module means adding it to an area.** `AREAS` in the refresh script is
the mapping from source file to row, and `api/tests/test_coverage_docs.py` fails
if a module or test module belongs to no area and is not listed in one of the
`UNMAPPED_*` sets.
