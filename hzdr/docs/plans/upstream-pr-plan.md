# Upstreaming plan: HZDR components → XFEL DAMNIT-web

Status: active — Phase 0 + Phase 1 complete; Phase 2 + Phase 3 remain
(reviewed 2026-07-23). Companion to [PR_NOTES.md](done/PR_NOTES.md),
which is an earlier single-PR draft; this plan supersedes it with a split-PR strategy.

## 1. Baseline and divergence

The fork's last common upstream commit is `3f38e60`
(*feat(frontend/context-file): persist Monaco editor view state (#205)*). Everything
after that is HZDR work:

- **195 files changed** vs that base: **137 added, 58 modified**, ~37.6k insertions.
- Additions are mostly self-contained (`api/.../metadata/hzdr_*`, `api/.../metadata/scicat.py`,
  `api/.../consumer/`, `frontend/apps/app/src/hzdr/`, `api/scripts/hzdr-*`, `hzdr/docs/`, tests).
- The sensitive part is the **58 modified upstream files** — that is what an upstream
  PR series has to keep small and reviewable.

Upstream `main` is currently at `d5a1081`
(*chore: better pre-commit and easier contributor onboarding (#214)*), i.e. ~eleven
merged PRs (#204, #210–#214 and the commits behind them) ahead of the fork point.
Every PR below is cut against `upstream/main`, not against this fork's `main`. The
newer upstream work adds three reconciliation points on top of the frontend changes:

- **#213 CI** now runs frontend lint and unit/browser tests on PRs, so PR 2–4's
  frontend changes (`login-route.tsx`, `table.tsx`, `saved-views-popover.tsx`) must
  pass upstream's own workflow, not just the fork's local lint.
- **#212 test scaffolding + #212/#211/#210/#204 table refactors** (upstream added
  vitest, `bounds.ts`, "pure core" extractions from the column-visibility hook, base
  cell tooltips, and tabler-icon error cells). The fork independently added
  `frontend/apps/app/vitest.config.ts` and `src/test-setup.ts` for the HZDR component
  tests, and the fork's `table.tsx` 2-line saved-views hook now sits on a `table.tsx`
  that upstream has since rewritten — expect conflicts on both the vitest config and
  `table.tsx`. Reconcile toward upstream's config/structure and re-apply the HZDR
  hook + test setup on top.
- **#214 onboarding/pre-commit** added `setup-dev.sh`, env templates, type-checks on
  pre-push, and paused pyright. PRs must satisfy upstream's pre-commit, and the fork's
  own `.pre-commit-config`/`.env.*.example` may conflict when merging upstream in.

Before Phase 1, enumerate the #204–#214 commits
(`git log --oneline 3f38e60..upstream/main`) and merge or rebase fork `main` onto
`upstream/main` so the disentanglement refactors happen on a current base.

## 2. Inventory of HZDR changes

### A. Upstream candidates — generic, config-gated, separable

| Component | Files | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **LDAP auth backend** | `auth/ldap.py` (new, 129 lines), small touches in `auth/{__init__,bootstrap,dependencies,models,routers}.py`, `LDAPSettings` in `shared/settings.py`, LDAP form in `packages/ui/src/routes/login-route.tsx` | Fully config-gated (`DW_API_AUTH__MODE=ldap`), default off. Useful to any facility without OIDC. Cleanest first PR. Tests: `test_auth_modes.py`. |
| **Runtime config endpoint + terminology** | `shared/routers.py` (`GET /config/runtime`, `GET /config/health`), `DeploymentSettings`/`TerminologySettings` | Generic mechanism (a deployment can label "Proposal" vs "Source", advertise auth mode to the frontend). **Defaults must be flipped back to EXFEL behavior before upstreaming** — the fork currently defaults `profile="hzdr"`, `uses_proposals=False`, `provider="local"`. |
| **Saved table views** | `packages/ui/.../saved-views-popover.tsx` (new), 2-line hook in `table.tsx`, `GET/POST/DELETE /metadata/.../views` routes + sidecar persistence | Generic feature; the 2-line integration into upstream's `table.tsx` is ideal. Needs a storage decision with upstream (fork uses a `.views.json` sidecar next to the catalog; upstream may prefer their DB). Rename `hzdr_saved_views*` → `saved_views*` when extracting. |
| **Run-without-MyMdC / metadata provider switch** | `MetadataSettings.provider` (`local`/`mongo`/`mymdc`), `DamnitSettings.paths_by_proposal`, conditional `_mymdc.bootstrap` in `main.py`, `data.py`/`db.py` normalization-compat changes | Architecturally the most valuable to other facilities, but opinionated — propose via an upstream issue/discussion **before** writing the PR. |
| **Small fixes** | `_logging.py` (1 line), `graphql/models.py` (+3), `graphql/queries.py` (2), `metadata/gql.py` (+3), API root `/` → `/docs` redirect in `main.py` | Bundle as one tiny "misc fixes" PR, or fold each into the PR that touches the same area. Verify each is a real fix, not an HZDR accommodation. |

### B. Fork-only — HZDR-specific, do not propose upstream

- `metadata/hzdr_event.py`, `hzdr_nexus.py`, `hzdr_sources.py`, `labfrog_sqlite.py`,
  `producer_status.py`, `metadata/scicat.py`, `shared/flow_activity.py`
- `consumer/` (ASAPO/Kafka durable spool consumers, `builder_trigger.py`) and their
  lifespan wiring, now in `consumer/bootstrap.py` (`spool_lifespan`) — the debounced
  auto-builder-trigger (`consumer/builder_trigger.py`, the `on_new_events_hook` in
  `consumer/spool.py`) landed 2026-07-04 and its startup/shutdown was extracted from
  `main.py` in C2 (✅ done, 2026-07-06).
- SciCat registration (`metadata/scicat.py`) — a fork-only builder post-step
  (`_register_scicat`) plus a `/scicat` route; the route moves out with the rest of
  the HZDR routes in C1.
- The ~1,350 added lines of `/metadata/hzdr/*` routes in `metadata/routers.py`
- All of `frontend/apps/app/src/hzdr/` (pages, components, utils, tests)
- `api/scripts/hzdr-*`, launchers (`hzdr/scripts/hzdr-launch.*`), `.env.*.example` profiles,
  HZDR docs, examples, fixtures, `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`/`PR_NOTES.md`
- HZDR-flavored parts of `contextfile/routers.py` (+425 lines): the per-user
  context-workspace endpoints run against `HZDRShot`/`HZDRSourceProvider`. The
  *concept* (per-user, per-source context files with `/results` execution) may
  interest upstream later, but the implementation is coupled to HZDR shots —
  raise as a discussion, not a PR, for now.

### C. Entangled — refactor in the fork before any PR can be cut

These upstream files currently mix generic and HZDR changes in one diff:

1. **`metadata/routers.py`** (was +1,348 lines): HZDR endpoints were interleaved into
   the upstream router module. ✅ **Done (2026-07-06):** all 20 `/metadata/hzdr/*`
   routes (incl. `/scicat`) + their models/constants/helpers moved verbatim into a new
   `metadata/hzdr_routers.py` (`hzdr_router`, same prefix/tags), mounted from `main.py`
   right after `metadata.router`. `routers.py` is back to ~20 lines (just the upstream
   `/proposal/{proposal_number}` route). Route union verified byte-identical to the
   pre-split baseline; full suite 290 passed. The generic saved-views routes stay under
   the `/hzdr/` prefix for now — they get renamed out when PR 4 (saved views) is cut.
2. **`main.py`** (+90/-4 → now smaller): three unrelated changes coexisted —
   conditional mymdc bootstrap (belongs to the provider PR), auth-router selection
   change (`settings.is_local` → `auth.is_disabled`, belongs to the LDAP PR), and
   fork-only lifespan wiring for the HZDR spool consumers **and** the debounced builder
   auto-trigger. ✅ **Done (2026-07-06):** the fork-only startup/shutdown was extracted
   into `consumer/bootstrap.py` (`spool_lifespan`, an async context manager owning both
   consumers + trigger); `main.py`'s lifespan now wraps its `yield` in a single
   `async with consumer_bootstrap.spool_lifespan(settings, logger)`. Characterization
   test: `tests/test_hzdr_consumer_bootstrap.py`. The mymdc-bootstrap and auth-router
   changes remain for the provider and LDAP PRs respectively.
3. **`shared/settings.py`** (was +490/-7): generic settings (`LDAPSettings`,
   `AuthSettings`, `DamnitSettings`, `MetadataSettings`, terminology/deployment,
   `ContextWorkspaceSettings`, `UvicornSettings`, the `Settings` model) were mixed
   in one module with the HZDR-only ones. ✅ **Done (2026-07-06):** the HZDR-only
   setting classes (`FlowMonitorSettings` + its producer/option subtypes,
   `HZDRSpoolSettings`, `HZDRKafkaSpoolSettings`, `HZDRBuilderSettings`,
   `HZDRHealthSettings`, `HZDRAsapoActivitySettings`, `HZDRScicatSettings`,
   `HZDRWikiSettings`) moved verbatim into a new `shared/hzdr_settings.py`;
   `settings.py` imports the eight top-level ones to wire them onto `Settings`,
   shrinking ~336 lines. The HZDR importers (`hzdr_routers.py`, `scicat.py`,
   `builder_trigger.py`, four `test_hzdr_*` tests) now import from `hzdr_settings`,
   so the boundary is real, not just a re-export. Behavior-preserving (full suite
   290 passed, acceptance green). Still to do at PR-cut time (Phase 2): restore
   EXFEL-preserving defaults on the *generic* settings that get upstreamed
   (`deployment.profile`, `terminology.uses_proposals`, `metadata.provider`).
4. **`frontend/apps/app/src/app.tsx`** (was +55/-11): HZDR routes, `AppHeader`
   replacement, and `HeroPage` → `/home` redirect are fork-only. ✅ **Done
   (2026-07-06):** the five HZDR-only routes (`/docs`, `/flow-monitor`,
   `/link-shot-records`, `/source/:source_key/context-builder`, `/source/:source_key`)
   moved into `hzdr/routes.tsx` (`hzdrRoutes()`, a fragment of `<Route>` elements);
   `app.tsx` drops them in as one `{hzdrRoutes()}` line, shrinking ~48 lines. Grouping
   is behavior-preserving — react-router v7 matches by rank, not source order, and no
   HZDR path collides with a generic one. `app.tsx`'s remaining fork delta is just the
   four fork-only imports, the `/` → `/home` redirect, and the `/home` route's
   `AppHeader` + `usesProposals` conditional. The upstream PRs do not touch `app.tsx`
   at all. Validated: `tsc -b`, eslint (0 errors), prettier (both new/changed files
   clean), vitest (124 passed), and a full `vite build`.
5. **`login-route.tsx`** (fully rewritten): keep, but re-verify the OIDC path is
   byte-for-byte behavior-identical when `ldap_form_enabled` is false — the reviewer
   will ask.

## 3. Proposed PR series (smallest first, each independent)

0. **Upstream issue/discussion** introducing the fork, linking this plan's summary,
   and asking two questions: (a) interest in LDAP + runtime-config + saved views,
   (b) appetite for the metadata-provider abstraction and, longer-term, a
   facility-extension mechanism (which would let the whole `hzdr/` tree live as a
   plugin instead of a fork).
1. **PR 1 — misc small fixes** (`_logging`, graphql tweaks, root→`/docs` redirect,
   and the Windows fix for `packages/ui/vitest.config.ts` — normalize the `@/`
   alias path to forward slashes, found during Phase 0; without it every unit
   test file fails to load on Windows). Trivial review, establishes the
   contribution relationship.
2. **PR 2 — `GET /config/runtime` + `GET /config/health` + terminology settings.**
   Defaults: `uses_proposals=true`, EXFEL labels. Frontend consumes nothing yet;
   pure additive API.
3. **PR 3 — LDAP auth backend** (API + login form). Depends on PR 2 (form is gated
   on runtime config). Includes `test_auth_modes.py`, docs for the `DW_API_AUTH__*`
   knobs, and the `is_local` → `auth.is_disabled` router-selection change with its
   rationale.
4. **PR 4 — saved table views** (popover + routes + persistence), after agreeing
   storage with upstream. All `hzdr_` prefixes renamed out.
5. **PR 5 — metadata provider / run-without-MyMdC**, only if the discussion in
   step 0 lands positively. Largest and most architectural; keep `mymdc` the default
   provider upstream.

Each PR: cut from `upstream/main`, conventional-commit style matching upstream
history (`feat(api): …`, `fix(frontend): …`), tests + docs included, target well
under ~500 changed lines, no behavior change for a default EXFEL deployment.

## 4. Work order in this fork

1. **Phase 0 — sync with upstream:** ✅ **Done (2026-07-07, merge commit
   `40d3e04`).** `upstream/main` (`d5a1081`, #214) merged into the fork on the
   upstream-PR branch. The six conflicts landed exactly as mapped below and were
   resolved per the sketches; `table.tsx` turned out easy — the fork's JSX line
   auto-merged, only the import block conflicted (union). The pre-commit pyright
   hook was kept active but moved to `stages: [pre-push]` (upstream paused it;
   the fork adopts upstream's pre-push staging instead). One semantic issue
   surfaced beyond the map: **upstream's `packages/ui/vitest.config.ts` alias is
   broken on Windows** (backslash paths from `fileURLToPath` make vite-node skip
   the `@/` alias, so all 12 unit-test files fail to load) — reproduced on
   pristine `upstream/main`, so it is an upstream bug, not a merge defect; fixed
   in the fork by normalizing to forward slashes, and **added to the PR 1
   misc-fixes bundle**. Validated post-merge: ruff clean; API suite 299 passed /
   5 skipped; `tsc` all projects; eslint 0 errors; `packages/ui` unit 79 passed;
   `apps/app` 124 passed; `vite build` succeeds. (Browser tests not run locally —
   upstream's #213 CI covers them.)

   The original conflict map, for reference:

   | File | Cause | Resolution sketch |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | `frontend/packages/ui/src/features/table/table.tsx` | upstream rewrote it (#210/#211/#212: pure-core extraction, base tooltip, tabler-icon error cells) under the fork's 2-line saved-views hook | take upstream's file, re-apply the saved-views hook on top — hardest of the six |
   | `api/src/damnit_api/graphql/models.py` | #204 made `DamnitRun.resolve()` error-aware vs the fork's return-type tweak | keep upstream's error-aware body; drop the fork's cosmetic annotation change (was a §2.A "small fix" candidate — now redundant) |
   | `.pre-commit-config.yaml` | #214 revamped hooks | union: upstream's hook set + the fork's extra hooks |
   | `README.md` (root) | #214 rewrote the top-level README | keep the fork's HZDR README, fold in upstream's quick-start/contributing pointers |
   | `frontend/package.json` | #212 added vitest/test deps | union the deps, then regenerate the lockfile |
   | `frontend/pnpm-lock.yaml` | dependency drift | do not hand-merge — resolve `package.json`, then `pnpm install` to regenerate |
2. **Phase 1 — disentangle (no behavior change, characterization tests first per
   repo convention):** items C1–C4 above. Validate each step with
   `uv run pytest`, `uv run ruff check .`, `pnpm run lint`,
   `python api/scripts/hzdr-local-acceptance.py`, and `pwsh hzdr/scripts/test-all.ps1`
   before the cross-repo-sensitive moves (the `hzdr_event.py` contract file must not
   move or change — it is vendored byte-identically into sibling repos).

   Progress: **Phase 1 complete — C1 + C2 + C3 + C4 all done (2026-07-06).** C2 —
   spool/trigger lifespan wiring extracted to `consumer/bootstrap.py`; `main.py`'s
   fork-only diff is now one `async with`. C1 — all HZDR routes moved to
   `metadata/hzdr_routers.py`, so `routers.py` is back to the upstream proposal route
   only. C3 — the HZDR-only setting classes moved to `shared/hzdr_settings.py`, so
   `shared/settings.py`'s diff against upstream is now just the generic settings (~336
   lines lighter). C4 — the five HZDR-only routes moved to `hzdr/routes.tsx`, so
   `app.tsx` drops them in as one `{hzdrRoutes()}` line. All four verified
   behavior-preserving (API suite 290 passed; C1 route union byte-identical to
   baseline; C3 acceptance green; C4 tsc/eslint/prettier/vitest 124-passed/vite build).
   The trial merge confirmed the API files (C1–C3) merge cleanly against
   `upstream/main`, and `app.tsx` (C4) is untouched by upstream — so all four were
   safe to do ahead of Phase 0 without rework. Phase 0 (the actual merge) followed
   on 2026-07-07 — see above. **Next: Phase 2** — cut the PR branches off
   `upstream/main`, starting with step 0 (the upstream issue/discussion) and PR 1.
3. **Phase 2 — extract PR branches:** for each PR in §3, cherry-pick/re-implement
   onto `upstream/main` in a fresh branch; flip defaults back to EXFEL; strip HZDR
   naming; run upstream's own CI workflows locally where possible.
4. **Phase 3 — converge:** as PRs merge, rebase the fork onto upstream/main and drop
   the now-duplicated commits, shrinking the permanent fork delta to bucket B only.

## 5. Open questions for upstream maintainers

- Saved-views persistence: sidecar JSON next to the data vs. their SQLAlchemy DB?
- Is `auth.is_disabled` (explicit no-auth mode) acceptable as a replacement for the
  `settings.is_local` heuristic?
- Any interest in a general "deployment profile / facility extension" mechanism that
  would let route bundles and header/branding be injected without patching `app.tsx`?
- Where should the LDAP dependency (`ldap3~=2.9`, currently a hard dependency in
  `api/pyproject.toml`) sit: hard dependency or optional extra (`damnit-api[ldap]`)?
  The imports in `auth/ldap.py` are already function-local, so an extra is cheap.
