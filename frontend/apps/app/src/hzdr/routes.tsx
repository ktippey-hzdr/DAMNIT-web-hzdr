/**
 * The HZDR-fork-only route block, extracted from `app.tsx` so that file stays
 * close to upstream DAMNIT-web (which defines none of these routes). Returned
 * as a fragment of `<Route>` elements — React Router flattens fragment children
 * inside `<Routes>`, so drop `{hzdrRoutes()}` in among the generic routes.
 *
 * Route matching in react-router v7 is rank-based, not source-order-based, so
 * grouping these together (rather than interleaved with the generic routes, as
 * they were inline) does not change which route a path resolves to.
